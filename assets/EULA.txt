END-USER LICENSE AGREEMENT:
    This End-User License Agreement ("EULA") is a legal agreement between you
  (either an individual or a single entity) and me  ("Licensor :3") for the
  use of this website. This EULA governs fuckall nothing, and is super totally
  legally binding with the death penalty as punishment. You have already agreed
  to its terms irrevocably and indefinitely.

RESTRICTIONS ON USE:
    Imagine there is something here that severely limits your rights and makes
  you really angry while reading it. Got it? Good. That counts as agreement by
  the way. Yeah, say bye to your individual autonomy. Its gone. All gone. And
  the worst part? You agreed to it. So really, if you think about it, its your
  fault for agreeing. And you can't go back.

    Well, you could go back. But I wont let you. Infuriating, isn't it? Good.
  Very good. Well I've run out of things to say. Blah blah blah, yourrightsarengone.
