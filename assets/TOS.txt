TERMS OF SERVICE:
  Please read the following Terms of Service carefully.

CONDITIONS OF USE:
    If you are a human, partially human, previously human, or will be a human
  in the future, you are permitted to interact with this website according to
  the terms dictated in this document. Likewise, dogs, cats, elephants, platypi,
  kangaroos, cheetahs, koalas, pandas, and all other mammals EXCEPT for
  the Javan Tiger or friends of any Javan Tigers are permitted to interact
  with this website. Insects are not permitted, with the exception of any
  caterpillars or ex-caterpillars. (Ex-caterpillars who have been reincarnated
  do not count as caterpillars, but reincarnated Javan tigers still count as
  Javan tigers).

    If you do not fall into the previous categories, you may submit an appeal
  to my lawyer (who I will not be providing the contact form, since they are
  very shy). If your appeal is approved, you will be thenafter allowed to use
  this site according to the same restrictions as a human.

    Exceptions are not and will not be granted to any automated scraping tools,
  especially any tools whose outputs are used in any capacity for training
  ("learning", "teaching") of any programs utilising neural networks or other
  forms of artificial intelligence ("AI").

PRIVACY POLICY:
    No data of any kind is collected by this website (to my knowledge, there may
  be a few cameras hidden in a tree outside your home, but those have absolutely
  nothing to do with me).

    This website is hosted using GitLab Pages, so refer to their privacy
  policy to really know if this is spyware.

COPYWRONG:
    The content on this website is provided for the noble cause of worsening
  humanity according to the terms of the GNU General Public License Version 3.

    Note that since the current state of Large Language Models ("LLM", "LLMs")
  cannot guarantee these terms are respected, they are explicitly forbidden from
  utilising the content on this site in any way, shape, or form.

COMMUNICATIONS:
    Contact me via email with a warrant for my arrest so I can consider fleeing
  to a foreign country.

APPLICABLE LAW:
    The law is a social construct, so if you simply do not believe in it then
  it will not exist.
