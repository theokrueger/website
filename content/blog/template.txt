USE_TOC: 1
-------------------------

this is the first line of content, automatically included in a div.
the first paragraph is automatically included as part of the DESCRIPTION variable.
the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
some six sick sphinx seriously sell super soakers? bdfgjqtvwxz.
html tags included in a paragraph like <div> *arent* parsed.
the DESCRIPTION variable also performs no parsing.
this template basically serves as a visual for the documentation from `man blogc-source`, as well as my terrible implementation of entries.
it serves no real purpose in the actual webpage, please remember to remove it from deployment

this second paragraph is not included in that variable
