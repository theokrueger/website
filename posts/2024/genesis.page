    POST_SUMMARY,
    "I created this website. There really isn't much to say about something as menial as that.
    Of course, I could pretend to have some grand vision of what this site is going to be, and that
    one day I might look back proudly on what I have made and be proud of the quality posts I've made.
    But I shouldn't have to explain why that's stupid."

              In reality, the sole purpose of this site is to serve as my long term memory.
              There are countless projects and ambitions of old that, for one reason or another, have
              entirely excused themselves from my mindspace. For the things important enough to
              spend a few minutes typing about here, I hopefully can invite them back into my head
              some time in the future. Plus, I need something to put on a business card :D

              That's it. Thats the first post. Pretty underwhelming you say? Yeah, probably.
              I only really needed some text here to make the post template. Should have just used
              Lorem Ipsum... Enjoy the website.
